# Spencer Turenne's micellaneous projects.
Notes: Jupyter Notebook takes up the most percentage because of file sizes. I am profficient in Java, C++, and Python. I am knowledgeable in JavaScript, C#, and many other languages.

* Java Database Creation - This directory contains two high school projects in which I was tasked with creating a database for a real client. It includes documentation for the process as well as the source code. OOP, GUI programming, Java, database.
* Space - This directory is a fun project I did over a week during a summer.  I followed a few tutorials and then by the end of the week created my own game. Video Game development.
* Roulette - This directory contains a java project which I try to recreate a roulette table (American) in Java. I have recreated this project multiple times across multiple languages as I am comfortable with the idea. OOP, Java.
* 5_card_stud.py - This python file takes an input of the cards a user has in a 5 card stud poker game. It then outputs the highest hhand they have (e.g. Full house would return Full house, not Three of a kind, two pair, or pair). Python.
* Bets.ipynb - The final project of my data science class. This file breaks down betsand how often they win for the NFL. Paired with Winners.ipynb. Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Data Science, Numpy.
* DecodingPythonPicture.PNG - This is a snip-it of my source code for my decryption algorithm. I could not find the source code for my encryption or decrpytion. It works by choosing a random number of characters and shift key. It then adds these and shifts that number of characters using the shift key. Once it reaches the number of characters it repeats the process. Created to go further than necessary in a Criminal Justice Digital Invesetigations class. Python, Encrption, Decrpytion.
* DualVNH5019MotorShield_Analog_Joystick_LessJerk.ino - Arduino program to use an analog joystick to control motors. Created for GoBabyGo! for use in their cars for children with disabilities. Arduino, Hardware interface.
* StartupCommands.py - Python program designed to run at startup which allowed me to type why I was using my laptop and open files accordingly. Useful when attending college so I could visually seperate life and school work. Python, OS package.
* Winners.ipynb - Similar to Bets.ipynb but for NFL teams winning instead of people betting. Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Data Science, Numpy.
* Polar+coords.py - Converter from Cartesian Coordinates to polar coordinates. Python.
* DiscreteGraphs.py - Application of topic learned in a math class to python. Input verticies and start/end locations. Returns the best route. Python.
* Group.pde, player.pde, sketch_19115a.pde - Folling a tutorial on Machine Learning gave me the framework. I make changes to see how it makes the situation change.
